# Generative Artificial Intelligence Powered by Optimal Transport

This repository demonstrates the application of collisional optimal transport in calibrating diffusion models used in Generative AI. As an example, we compare our approach with the well-known Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) in generating images of MNIST, CIFAR10, and Food101.
